Coleman, who both reads lips and uses hearing aids on and off the field, remained undaunted. He makes it a point to keep his helmet lowest in the huddle, so that he can use his hearing aids to hear the play from quarterback Russell Wilson, and constantly stays close to offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell on the sidelines. 

In addition to his NFL career, Coleman takes time to speak to young children about achieving success despite obstacles. "When people tell me I can't do something," he says, "I'm going to work hard to do it.“

It's that doubt, he says, that is difficult. "Those are where the biggest challenges are," he says. "People don't really understand you." Coleman tries to impart this to kids in his talks, he says.

Coleman has also made it clear that his deafness is neither an excuse nor a crutch. He's quick to point out that if he misinterprets a play, it wasn't because he didn't understand it, but rather because he didn't know where he was supposed to be. 

"I don't ever use my hearing as an excuse," he says. 

Coleman is young enough in his NFL career that it's hard to predict how his future will unfold, but there's no doubt he will continue to inspire fans and teammates as he proves that being deaf isn't something to "overcome" -- it can be an advantage when it comes to perseverance.
 
"I've got to work extra hard," he says. "If you really want something, you're going to work extra hard already. No matter what the obstacle is -- hearing loss, or you can't speak, or whatever the problem is -- there’s always a way, and you can always go for your dream or whatever you want to do.“

Oh, and if his football career doesn't work out? Coleman says he'd lean on his degree in political science, either to enter the police academy or attend law school. At this point, it would be foolish to think that his hearing, and not his perseverance and work ethic, would set him apart in those fields either.
