Four have already been revealed — one has a zig-zagging chevron print, and another is black and flowery and called "rosemaling" — and several more will be unveiled throughout the Olympics. It’s all very top-secret at the moment, but prepare to be amazed.

"Because we know them, we probably won’t be shocked," said British curler Anna Sloan, who has become good friends with the Norwegian team. "But trust me, it will be good."
Initially stunned, World Curling President Kate Caithness has embraced the pants, which have added a whole new dimension to curling.

"I am a traditionalist, I must be honest," Caithness said in a telephone interview with the AP. "But after I saw them in Vancouver, I actually liked them. They brought focus to our sport, these crazy pants.”

"It would be awful if all the teams were wearing them — it would look like a circus. But I think it’s a trademark of the Norwegian team only and we like it that way.“

Svae hopes so, too. After all, it was he who came up with the idea in the first place.

The long-time Norway international curler was unhappy at the black-and-gray colored uniform his team had been given for Vancouver, and asked its equipment sponsor a month before the Olympics to make them some colored pants. There wasn’t enough time, so he went online to find some goofy golf pants.

He happened upon Loudmouth, an American sportswear company known for its flamboyant attire. Golfer John Daly and rock singer Alice Cooper are customers.

"It’s definitely been life-changing for us," Svae said. "Not so much in the everyday but when we travel around the world for curling, it doesn’t always matter if we do well or not, people still think that we win stuff because we are always in the media.“

"I don’t think you’ll see a lot of the other teams do the same that we did," Svae added, "they feel it’s our thing.“

Larry Jackson, the CEO of Loudmouth, says his company’s server went into meltdown several times during the 2010 Olympic final, such was the onslaught of traffic from customers wanting to snap up some pants.
